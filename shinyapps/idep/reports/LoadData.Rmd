```{asis, eval=(ReactVars$DataSource == 'Public')}

** The data used in this report is from a public data source. **
TODO: We should add more information about the data source. like: source, test id, sample id.

```

```{asis, eval=(ReactVars$DataSource == 'Client')}
** The data used in this report is uploaded by user. **
TODO: ????

```

```{asis, eval=(ReactVars$DataSource == 'Demo')}

The data used in this report is the demo data.
TODO: add some description about the demo data. 

```

```{asis, eval = (input$dataFileFormat == 1) }
The data type is **Raw read counts data**.
Raw read count data is one type of [Gene expression matrix](https://idepsite.wordpress.com/data-format#gene_expression_matrix).

TODO: add more description about read count data

```{asis, eval = (input$dataFileFormat == 3) }
The data type is **Fold-changes and P values**.
The log fold-changes (LFCs) and P values can be derived from Cuffdiff or other programs.
[More detail about Fold-changes and P values](https://idepsite.wordpress.com/data-format#LFCs).
TODO: add some description about Fold-changes and corrected P values from CuffDiff or any other program

```

### 1.2 Test design

```{asis, eval=is.null(ReactVars$RawTestDesign)}

*** No test design file is uploaded in this analysis. ***
iDep will group the sample based on sample name. (column name in data file)
For more detail, please check ( TODO: Add a link to sample group rule section )

```

```{asis, eval!=is.null(ReactVars$RawTestDesign)}
